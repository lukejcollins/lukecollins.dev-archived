This repository contains the code of my first ever attempt at learning Django by creating a website. Alongside learning Django, I also dipped my toes into self-hosting a site and utilizing GitHub Actions for automated deployment. This project served as an invaluable learning experience for me.

## Learning Journey
Throughout the development of this website, I've tried my hand at several new skills:

- **Django**: Used Django as the web framework for creating the website.
- **Self-Hosting**: Explored self-hosting options and deployed the website on my own server.
- **GitHub Actions**: Created a workflow using GitHub Actions for automated deployment to the server (I've removed the action to avoid triggering it, but it is visible in the commit history).

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Web framework for building the website.
- **Python**: Backend programming language.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automated deployment.

## Final Words
This project was a great learning experience in Django, self-hosting, and utilizing GitHub Actions. I hope you find this repository useful. Since it's my first attempt, there might be some inefficiencies or areas of improvement. Feel free to explore the code and learn along with me.

Thank you for visiting!
